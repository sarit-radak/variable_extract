# Extracting Variable Regions from Nanopore Reads

This code is designed to extract diverse amino acid stretches (variable regions) from Oxford Nanopore reads. Given the nucleotide sequences that flank each region (flanking regions), it uses a blast search to identify the location of each variable region in each read. It then extracts the regions, translates them, and writes them to an output file.

For QC purposes, the code also keeps track of the number of reads that it successfully processes.

I've included additional scripts that calculate the frequency of each unique sequence (rank_variable.py), the amino acid frequencies at each position (calc_freq.py), and the fold-change in frequencies between two libraries (calc_fc.py)

### Environment

Everything happens in a single project directory. The following subdirectories are used to keep all of the files organized.

| Directory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `blastdb/` | database of flanking regions that the reads are blasted against |
| `files/` | raw fastq/fasta files, blast outputs, and other files generated by the code |
| `logs/` | log files from the slurm jobs |
| `pythonfiles/` | python files used for processing the data |

All of the code is run through `extract.sh`.

### To Do

1. Make a copy of this repo in garibaldi
2. Give the job a descriptive name in `extract.sh`
3. Adjust the number of arrays requested in `extract.sh` (typically 1-n, where n is the number of libraries being analyzed)
4. Add the names of the libraries to the variable “libraries” in `extract.sh`
5. Move the library fastq files to folders inside the `files/` directory.
6. Collect the flanking regions into a single file (`blastdb/flanking_regions.xlsx`)
    1. For instances where there are multiple possible lengths, separate them with commas. If the DNA is encoded on the antisense strand of DNA, denote "Bottom" in the "Strand" column.
    2. Regions can be any length. Shorter lengths will run faster. Lengths longer than 8nt don’t increase the number of reads that are successfully processed ([24-12-02 BLAST Strategy Speedtest](https://www.notion.so/24-12-02-BLAST-Strategy-Speedtest-151e5b183a4c809f8383e27a30bd3221?pvs=21))
8. Specify the number of regions to extract in `extract.sh`
9. Run


I've left a test dataset ("test_assembled.fasta") in this repo for troubleshooting. With a length cutoff of 3,000 bp, it should have 1,934 sequences successfully extracted, 1,661 with a variable region of the wrong length, 4 that are missing flanking regions, and 1,633 that are too short.
